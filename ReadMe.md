# CS 2.1: Advanced Trees & Sorting Algorithms

## Course Description

In this course students will implement and test advanced data structures and algorithms, benchmark performance, analyze algorithmic complexity, explore trade offs in performance and memory usage, and draw out elegant problem-solving techniques.

Key concepts include sorting algorithms, divide-and-conquer recursion, heaps, tries, self-balancing trees, and execution trees. Students will build an original project that applies these data structures to real-world problems such as autocomplete, family trees, and board games.

Students will also write technical articles about these topics to deepen their understanding and create their online presence as knowledgeable and proficient software engineers.
